						SENDING EMAIL USING NODE.JS

AIM:

	To develop a Node.js program to send an email using the Node mailer module and a Gmail account with App Password authentication.

ALGORITHM:

	1)Install Node.js and the Nodemailer module.
	2)Open Command Prompt and run the command:
	3)npm install nodemailer
	4)Enable 2-Step Verification for your Gmail account (if not already enabled).
	5)Generate an App Password from your Google Account settings to be used instead of your regular password.
	6)Write the Node.js code to send an email using Nodemailer, with your Gmail address and the generated App Password.
	7)Run the Node.js script from the Command Prompt using:
	8)node EX-NO-08.js
	9)Check the recipient’s email inbox to confirm that the email has been received.
	10)End the program.

PROCEDURE:

	1)Download and install the Nodemailer module using NPM in the Node.js Command Prompt.
	2)C:\Users\Suresh> npm install nodemailer
	3)Enter the Node.js code in Notepad and save it as EXNO8.js in your Node.js folder (Example: C:\Users\Student).
	4)Generate an App Password (for Gmail users):

		i)Go to your Google Account → Security Settings.
		ii)Enable 2-Step Verification if it is not already enabled.
		iii)Under the Signing in to Google section, click App Passwords.
		iv)Generate a password for your Node.js application.
		v)Use this generated password in the auth.pass field in the Node.js code.

PROGRAM:

const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
service: 'gmail',
auth: {
user: 'your-email@gmail.com', // replace with your Gmail address
pass: 'your-app-password'     // replace with your generated App Password
}
});
const mailOptions = {
from: 'your-email@gmail.com',
to: 'recipient-email@gmail.com', // replace with recipient email
subject: 'Test Email from Node.js',
text: 'This is a test email sent using Node.js!',
html: '<b>This is a test email sent using Node.js!</b>'
};
transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, function(error, info){
if(error){
console.log('Error occurred:', error.message);
} else {
console.log('Email sent successfully:', info.response);
}
});

RESULT:

	Thus, the above Node.js program is executed and the output is obtained successfully.
